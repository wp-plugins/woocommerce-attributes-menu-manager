Show Woocommerce Custom Attributes in Wordpress Menu Page

== Description ==
Attributes (which can be used for the layered nav) are a custom taxonomy, meaning you can display them in menus, or display products by attributes.

<h4> Create a template </h4>
You will need to theme your attribute to make it display products how you want. To do this:

* Copy `woocommerce/templates/taxonomy-product_cat.php` into your theme folder
* Rename the template to reflect your attribute – in our example we’d use `taxonomy-pa_size.php`

Thats all there is to it. You will now see this template when viewing taxonomy terms for your custom attribute.

**Settings Available Under**
`Products ==> Attributes Menu Manager`
